# INVAE
Introduction

A implementation of INVAE. 
INVAE can predict perturbations responses for single-cell. Moreover, INVAE can shows the similarities in the perturbation responses of different cell types.

Example

We provide a Jupyter Notebook file as an example to show how to run the function we mentioned in the paper. Including how to train the model, result evaluating and visualization of the condition-invariance space and the condition-specific space output. 
INVAE support the h5ad format, you can train your own data by changing the data path in the example file.
